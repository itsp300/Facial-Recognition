So what I want you to do is store the image in a db, with the match + certainty, then take the pk you use to store that and send it back to me, server doesn't handle any storage of face data at all.

{
    "type": "face_rec_identifier",
    "id": "", //some identifier you use internally
    "record_id": "5" //the record id from the request (I provide this in my face_rec call)
}


Then if I want detailed info I'll send:

{
    "type": "face_rec_details",
    "id": "", //your db pk face id
}


and you can respond with

{
    "type": "face_rec_details",
    "identified":[
    {
        "person_id": "hc7x...",
        "certainty": "0.8"
    },
    {
        "person_id": "asdd...",
        "certainty": "0.5"
    }
    ]
}

Decode and Encode an Image in Base64
import base64

image = open('test.jpg', 'rb')
image_read = image.read()
req_encode = base64.encodebytes(image_read)
print(req_encode)


# Decode the image into temp image file
image_64_decode = base64.decodebytes(req_encode)
image_result = open('test.jpg','wb')
image_result.write(image_64_decode)
